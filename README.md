### Code
Here is the link of my code [board blinking code](https://github.com/msadat50/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/LED_blink.py).

### Reflection
This assignment was confusing at first because I didn't know how Pico works, after Mr. Miller explained it to me it made a lot of sense. I had a little bit of trouble doing the while true loop, but Mr. Miller helped me do that. Overall it was super easy and simple.


## Launch_Pad_Part_1_Countdown

### Assignment Description
In this assignment we're setting a Countdown from 10 seconds to 0 (liftoff), Which will be printed in serial monitor.

### Code
Here is the link of my code [countdown](https://github.com/msadat50/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/countdown)

### Reflection
This assingment was confusing because in other assignment there was example code, so that would help you do this assignment. In this assignment I did research on how to use a for loop. I had trouble with the countdown where it was printing from 1-10 instead of of 10-0, but Mr. Miller helped me figure it out.  



## Launch_Pad_Part_2_"Lights"

### Assignment Description
In this assignment we're making blink a red light each second of the countdown, and then turn on a blue LED to signify liftoff.

### Reflection
This assignment was not as confusing as the first one because there was visuals that helped me understand it.Still I had trouble doing with the visual app which made it hard for me to do the assignment,but Mr. Miller helped me out. Other then that everything else was good. 


## Launch_Pad_Part_3_"Button"

### Assignment Description
In this assignment we're adding a physical button that will starts the countdown. 

### Evidence

### Reflection
This assignment was easy. All I had to do is copy and paste the code that was given to us. The only thing that made me confuse was the wiring for button, I wasn't sure if I need to witing the button using a pin. 


## Launch_Pad_Part_4_"Servo"

### Assignment Description
In this assihgnment we're adding a servo, which will trun 180 when the countdown is over, the blue LED will trun on.

### Evidence

### Reflection
I didn't had any trouble doing this assignment. I just had some typo in the code, but Mr. Miller helped me fix it. Everything was easy and I got very happy when I got the assginment done. 


## Crash_Avoidance_Part_1_Accelerometer

### Assignment Description
In this assignment we will use a accelerometer that continuously reports x, y, and z acceleration values on the serial monitor

### Evidence

### Reflection
This assignment was confusing at first, but after Mr. Miller explain I knew what I need to do it was clear and easy. I had trouble with the distance of each line like the vaule that we were suppose to put it, so when that when it shows in the OLED screen it should be clear and speaced out. Mine was just all together, but Mr. Miller helped me figure it out


## Crash_Avoidance_Part_2_Light_and_Powerboost

### Reflection
This assignment was hard because there wasn't any code to get you started. I was struggling through this assingment and I didn't know what to do or how to do, but than I said I will start with LED since we are trying to turn on an led. After I did I asked help from Mr. Miller then he explained what I need to do and he even helped me get started. 

## Crash_Avoidance_OLED_Screen

### Assignment Description
In the assignment we must have an onboard screen that prints x, y, and z angular velocity values (rad/s) and need to be rounded to 3 decimal places

### Reflection
This was easy because we had a code to start with.I went back and forward to the last assignment we did and pull some codes from there, but this time I had so many trouble with wiring. I always had the write in the wrong place, but thanks to MR. Miller he helped me out.  


## Landing_Area_Functions

### Assignment Description
In this assignment we're trying to a set of three coordinates in (x,y). format the triangle area must be determined using a function
If the user inputs coordinates incorrectly (letters or improper format) than the code should return to the input stage. The triangle area must be printed to the screen in this format: â€œThe area of the triangle with vertices (x,y), (x,y), (x,y) is {area} square km and than the code must return to the input stage after printing the area, and wait for user input.

### Reflection
This assignment was really confusing. In this assignment I learned how to use functions. I had trouble incorporating math into my code because I didn't know how to use functions. Ellen's github page also helped me understand the code needs to be done. 

## Landing_Area_Plotting


### Assignment Description
In the assignment we are using an OLED screen that must plot each triangle on a graph relative to the base location

### Evidence

### Reflection
This assignment was actual really easy because it was copying and pasting from the last 2 assignments we did. The only trouble that I has was not know how to locate the triangle and I didn't know how to write the area of a triangle, but thanks to Ellen Lynch her github helped me understand how to write the equation of a triangle. After writing the area I still had trouble because the triangle wasn't coming up in the screen, but thanks to Mr. Miller he helped me get it done. 


This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch.

# Beam Part 1

### Assignment Description

Design a beam with the goal of maximizing weight beofre failure. it cannot bend more than 35mm.

### Reflection

We decided that a vertical beam would much much stronger. We reduced weight by chamfering the end where the bucket would be attached. We cut a hole in the beam near the end to reduce weight and since its near the downward force the stress would be less.


## Beam Part 2

### Assignment Description

Run one static finite element analysis on your beam to determine what areas need to be improved.

### Part Image

![Design for beam 2](https://github.com/Graham913/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/images/beam%20project%20.png) 

### Reflection

After running the simulation we determined that the place of most stressed was close to where the base of the beam is. We managed to chamfer off a little more from the other end of them beam and added supported on each side. Putting holes in the beam near where the bucket is held doesnt take off much stress but takes off weight. 


### FEA part 3

### Assignment Description
The purpose of this assignment was to improve the maximum weight the beam can hold before bending or breaking.

### Reflection
Our original design was weak at the base and we made it strong by adding more materials at the base. After running it through the Simulation the red spot improved. We still had some materials left, so we decide to make the base a little bit thicker. After we did that it was much better and we liked it.
