## Pi_Pico_Introduction

### Assignment Description
In this assignment we're trying to make the raspberry Pi board LED bilnk. 

### Evidence

### Code
Here is the link of my code [board blinking code](https://github.com/msadat50/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/LED_blink.py).

### Reflection
This assignment was so super simple and easy. I had a little bit of trouble doing the while true loop, but Mr. Miller helped me do that. 


## Launch_Pad_Part_1_"Countdown"

### Assignment Description
In this assignment we're setting a Countdown from 10 seconds to 0 (liftoff), Which will be printed in serial monitor.

### Evidence

### Code
Here is the link of my code [countdown](https://github.com/msadat50/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/countdown)

### Wiring

### Reflection
This assingment was confusing because in other assignment there was example code, so that would help you do this assignment. In this assignment we did research and Mr. Miller helped me figure it out.  



## Launch_Pad_Part_2_"Lights"

### Assignment Description
In this assignment we're making blink a red light each second of the countdown, and then turn on a blue LED to signify liftoff.

### Evidence

### Code
Here is the link of my code [countdown](https://github.com/msadat50/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Launch%20pad%20part%202%20making%20both%20LED%20blink)

### Wiring

### Reflection
This assignment was not as confusing as the first one because there was visuals that helped me understand it.Still I had trouble doing with the visual app which made it hard for me to do the assignment,but Mr. Miller helped me out.Other then that everything else was good. 


## Launch_Pad_Part_3_"Button"

### Assignment Description
In this assignment we're adding a physical button that will starts the countdown. 

### Evidence

### Code
Here is the link of my code [Button](https://github.com/msadat50/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/LaunchpadButton)

### Wiring

### Reflection
This assignment was super easy. All I had to do is copy and paste, the only thing that made me confuse was the wiring for button, I wasn't sure if I need to witing the button using a pin. 


## Launch_Pad_Part_4_"Servo"

### Assignment Description
In this assihgnment we're adding a servo, which will trun 180 when the countdown is over, the blue LED will trun on.

### Evidence

### Code
Here is the link of my code [Servo](https://github.com/msadat50/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/LaunchPadServo)

### Wiring

### Reflection
I didn't had any trouble doing this assignment, I jhust some typo in the code. 


## Crash_Avoidance_Part_1_Accelerometer

### Assignment Description
### Evidence 
### Code
Here is the link of my code [Accelerometer](https://github.com/msadat50/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Crash%20Avoidance%20Part%201%20(Accelerometer)

### Assignment Description
### Evidence 
### Code
Here is the link of my code [OLED Screen]()

### Wiring
### Reflection







This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch.

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
