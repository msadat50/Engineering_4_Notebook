### Code
Here is the link of my code [board blinking code](https://github.com/msadat50/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/LED_blink.py).

### Reflection
This assignment was so super simple and easy. I had a little bit of trouble doing the while true loop, but Mr. Miller helped me do that. 


## Launch_Pad_Part_1_Countdown

### Assignment Description

### Reflection
This assignment was not as confusing as the first one because there was visuals that helped me understand it.Still I had trouble doing with the visual app which made it hard for me to do the assignment,but Mr. Miller helped me out.Other then that everything else was good.

### Reflection
This assignment was confusing at first, but after Mr. Miller explain I knew what I need to do it was clear and easy. I had trouble with the distance of each line like the vaule that we were suppose to put it, so when that when it shows in the OLED screen it should be clear and speaced out. Mine was just all together, but Mr. Miller helped me figure it out


## Crash_Avoidance_Part_2_Light_and_Powerboost

### Assignment Description
In this assignment we are trying to turn on a led when board is tilted to 90 degrees and it mast be powered by a mobile power source.

### Reflection
This assignment was hard because there wasn't any code to get you started, I was struggling through this assingment I didn't know what to do or how to do, bu than I said I will start with LED since we are trying to turn on an led. After I did I asked help from Mr. Miller then he explained what I need to do and he even helped me get started. 

## Crash_Avoidance_OLED_Screen

### Assignment Description
In the assignment we must have an onboard screen that prints x, y, and z angular velocity values (rad/s) and need to be rounded to 3 decimal places

### Reflection
This was easy because we had a code to start and I went back a forward to the last assignment we did and pull some codes from there, but this time I had so many trouble with wiring I always had the write in the wrong place. Thanks to MR. Miller he helped me out.

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch.

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
